# Problem Statement
**PS-05: "Silent Disease" Early Detection Engine**  
Detect What Patients Don’t Even Know They Have

A large percentage of life-threatening diseases (diabetes, hypertension, liver disorders, mental health conditions, early cardiac risk) remain undiagnosed for years because symptoms are mild, ignored, or fragmented across reports. Healthcare systems rely heavily on reactive diagnosis rather than predictive prevention.

**Challenge:** Build an AI-driven early risk detection system that:  
- Aggregates non-obvious health signals:  
  - Lab trends over time  
  - Lifestyle data (sleep, activity, nutrition)  
  - Stress & mental health indicators  
  - Family history patterns  
- Detects silent or early-stage diseases before clinical diagnosis  
- Generates **risk probability scores** (not binary outcomes)  
- Provides preventive action recommendations for patients and doctors

# Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered platform that predicts early risks for silent diseases. Patients can input their lab results, lifestyle, stress levels, and family history to get a **personalized risk report**. Doctors can use it to **monitor patients proactively**.

---

# Features
- Multi-step patient input form for demographics, labs, lifestyle, stress, and family history  
- Dashboard showing **risk probability scores** for multiple diseases  
- Charts for lab trends over time  
- Preventive recommendations for patients and doctors  
- Downloadable reports
